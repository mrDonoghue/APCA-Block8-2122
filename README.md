## Warmup
* Do a good chunk of [2DArrayIntro](https://runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=103412) to practice 2D arrays. Don't feel like you need to do every single assignment. The goal is for you to practice until you feel somewhat comfortable.

* **DON'T JUST SIT THERE.** If you finish, do old assignments or study
